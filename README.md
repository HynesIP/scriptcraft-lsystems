scriptcraft-lsystems
====================

Fun with ScriptCraft &amp; L-systems

To install:

1. Replace the drone.js file here with the one that comes with ScriptCraft (this drone.js has a moveTo method and exposes its x & y coords, which are all needed for push/popping turtle state).
2. Place the lsystem.js file and the two example files in your ScriptCraft file dir (you create this when following the ScriptCraft installation instructions).

Have fun and send any cool L-system scripts my way!
